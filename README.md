# Swipe Game
## Introduction

Generative AI is booming, and so is the creation of fakes and deep fakes. At the same time, there is a lack of fun and easy-to-use deep fake detection exercises in schools. This is where Fight Fakes comes in, developing a game environment where young people can playfully learn to evaluate information quickly and intuitively. 

The Swipe Game is part of Fight Fakes. The game presents a series of cards that the player can swipe to the right (true) or left (false). 

Fight Fakes is a project of the [Ã–IAT (Austrian Institute for Applied Telecommunication)](https://oiat.at/) initiatitve [Saferinternet.at](https://saferinternet.at/) and was funded by [netidee](https://www.netidee.at/).
